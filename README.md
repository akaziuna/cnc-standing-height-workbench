CNC Maker Bench
=============================
This repo contains supplemental material for my MAKE tutorial, "CNC Maker Bench" (http://makezine.com/cnc-maker-bench), which also appeared in MAKE magazine vol. 38 (http://makezine.com/volume/make-38-cameras-and-av/). The tutorial explains how to build an customized standing height workbench using a CNC router and AtFab's (http://atfab.co) 'One to Several' parametric Processing table configuration app.
