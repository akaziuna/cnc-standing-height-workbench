cnc-standing-height-workbench
=============================

This repo contains supplemental material for my MAKE magazine tutorial, "CNC Maker Bench" (http://makezine.com/cnc-maker-bench). The tutorial explains how to build a standing height workbench on a CNC router using AtFab's (http://atfab.co/) One to Several parametric table configuration app. "CNC Maker Bench" also appeared in MAKE vol. 38. The One to Several table app is available for download from this repo with the permission of AtFab.
