=============================

This repo contains supplemental material for my MAKE magazine tutorial (http://makezine.com/cnc-maker-bench) on how to build a Standing Height Workbench on a CNC router using AtFab's (http://atfab.co/) One to Several parametric table configuration app.  The One to Several table app is available for download from this repo with the permission of AtFab.
