CNC Maker Bench
=============================
This repo contains supplemental material for my MAKE tutorial, ["CNC Maker Bench"](http://makezine.com/cnc-maker-bench), which also appeared in [MAKE: vol. 38](http://makezine.com/volume/make-38-cameras-and-av/). The tutorial explains how to build an customized standing height workbench using a CNC router and [AtFab's](http://atfab.co) 'One to Several' parametric Processing table configuration app.
